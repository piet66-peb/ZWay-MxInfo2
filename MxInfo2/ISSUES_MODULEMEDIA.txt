ZWay API issues calling from 
http://IP:8083/ZAutomation/api/v1/load/modulemedia/<module>/...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZWay Version V3.2.3

Issues
======
1. charset="utf-8:
   Ä Ö Ü ä ö ü are displayed as Ã Ã Ã Ã¤ Ã¶ Ã¼
   The server ignores the utf-8 directive in meta tag as well as in
   script tag.
   >> workaround: transcode all texts in javascript 

2. return folder contents:
   calling a path without file.html and no index.html (/ or not at end):
   empty folder contents returned
   >> unable to dynamically create tools index, unable to search for special icons
   >> workaround: use fixed file list

3. looking for default index.html, if only path given:
   /ZAutomation/api/v1/load/modulemedia/<module> and
   /ZAutomation/api/v1/load/modulemedia/<module>/
   returns 'Not Found'

4. looking for default index.html, if only path given:
   /ZAutomation/api/v1/load/modulemedia/<module>/<subfolder> (no slash at end)
   index.html is found but called with wrong working directory
   >>workaround: set absolute path with base tag in index.html

5. Basic Authentication:
   Enters the user wrong login data (or no login data) ZWay answeres with 401
   (not authorized) but without 'WWW-Authenticate' header.
   Result: The browser stores the wrong login data for further use. The user
   has no chance for correction any more.
   also SmarthomeUI login doesn't work any more (in Firefox).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RFC 7235, page 4:
Upon receipt of a request for a protected resource that omits
credentials, contains invalid credentials (e.g., a bad password) or
partial credentials (e.g., when the authentication scheme requires
more than one round trip), an origin server SHOULD send a 401
(Unauthorized) response that contains a WWW-Authenticate header field with 
at least one (possibly new) challenge applicable to the requested resource.

6. session cookies:
   At tab change sometimes ZWAYSession is emptied: ZWAYSession = ''
